Bootstrap for meteor
====================

This package is a fork of `nemo64:bootstrap` package. 

The goal here is to change the name of the output file from `custom.bootstrap.less` to `custom.bootstrap.output.import.less` so that we can load the file from another less file and override bootstrap variables.
